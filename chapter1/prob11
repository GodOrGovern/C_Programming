Q: How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

A: I would type special characters other than the few it accounts for (eg NULL,
ESC, CAN). I would also try overflowing the word count by typing (or
generating) more words than it is capable of reflecting. This could equally be
accomplished for the character and line count. Inputs with characters that are
not accounted for by the program and extremely long inputs are most likely to
uncover bugs.
